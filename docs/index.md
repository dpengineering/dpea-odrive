## Welcome to the DPEA ODrive Guide

This page is meant to be a resource to help you get your ODrive up and running as smoothly as possible.
Additionally, this is not meant to be a replacement for 
the [official ODrive documentation](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/0.5.6/getting-started.html), but rather it will 
highlight the various ways you can use Python to communicate with the existing ODrive library.
