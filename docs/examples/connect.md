## Connecting to a Single ODrive
```python
from dpea_odrive.odrive_helpers import *
od = find_odrive(serial_number="12345ABC")

assert od.config.enable_brake_resistor is True, "Check for faulty brake resistor."

# axis0 and axis1 correspond to M0 and M1 on the ODrive
ax = ODriveAxis(od.axis0)

dump_errors(od)
```
The `ax = ODriveAxis(od.axis0)` line is used to refer to one of the two motors on our board. Each ODrive board can
control up to two motors. Take a look at the example below to see how you can connect to a 3-axis setup.

## Connecting to Multiple ODrives
The `serial_number` for each board can be found by running `odrivetool` or calling `find_odrive()`. The serial number 
will be noted in the text that says, `Connected to <serial_number> as odrv0`. This text will be blue in`odrivetool` or 
will be printed during the call to `find_odrive()`. Have one ODrive plugged in at a time to isolate each serial number.
```python
from odrive_helpers import *

od_xy = find_odrive(serial_number="12345ABC")
od_z = find_odrive(serial_number="67890DEF")

assert od_xy.config.enable_brake_resistor is True, "Check for faulty brake resistor."
assert od_z.config.enable_brake_resistor is True, "Check for faulty brake resistor."

# axis0 and axis1 correspond to M0 and M1 on the ODrive
x_axis = ODriveAxis(od_xy.axis0)
y_axis = ODriveAxis(od_xy.axis1)
z_axis = ODriveAxis(od_z.axis0)

dump_errors(od_xy)
dump_errors(od_z)
```
